## FAQ

### Is it safe for me to enter my RapidAPI key?

This extension uses your browsers local storage meaning, the API key is stored locally on your machine and it is only used when making a request to RapidAPI. Removing the extension from your browser also means that this data is removed.

### How do I request an RapidAPI key for Bionic Reading API?

Documentation of using RapidAPI can be found [here](https://docs.rapidapi.com/docs/consumer-quick-start-guide).

## Improvements

- [ ] Add styling to extensions HTML pages,
- [ ] Use a pop-up for the API response, rather than opening in a new tab,
- [ ] Better error handling, e.g. inform the user if they have reached their request limit for the day.
- [ ] Tidy-up the code :sweat_smile:
